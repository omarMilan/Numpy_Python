*********Creating an array**************

a.shape = (3,1)				#changed the shape to 3 by 2

a = np.linspace(2,10,4)			#make an array, with a size of 4, that gives random numbers from 2 to 10 

a = np.array([5,2,5,7])			# ([5,2,5,7])  <-- array
a < 3					# where a is less than 3 (false, true, false, false)
a[a<3]					# get me array where a is less than 3  ([2])
np.sort(a)				#sorts array

?a					#gives a full list of information of that numpy array
?a.shape				#narrows down the information to .shape

z[0:2]					#slice (take a part of the array)

**********Skimage*******************

plt.show()					#2 to show photo

plt.imshow(photo[50:150, 150:280])		#show photo zoomed in or sliced in those coordinates

np.sum(photo)					#adds all the numbers of array. you can do this with any function

photo_masked = np.where(photo > 100, 255, 0)	#wherever the photo is greater than 100, replace it with 255 and where its not, replace is with 0     THIS IS AN EXPOSURE FILTER
